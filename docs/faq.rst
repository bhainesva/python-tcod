How do you set a frames-per-second while using contexts?
--------------------------------------------------------

You'll need to use an external tool to manage the framerate.
This can either be your own custom tool or you can copy the Clock class from the
`framerate.py <https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod/blob/develop/examples/framerate.py>`_
example.
